# Advent of Code 2020

Here are my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) problems.

## Repo structure

The structure of this repo is as follows:

- `/inputs/` - the inputs for each day
- `/elixir/` - mix project containing the solutions, every day in a separate module
- `/clojure/` - lein project containing the solutions, every day in a separate namespace
- `/rust/` - cargo project containing the solutions, every day in a separate module
- `/haskell/` - stack project containing the solutions, every day in a separate module

## Goal

The reason why I choose to do this exercise in multiple languages is to learn more about how each language's strengths will help me, which might impact how I code in other languages (for the better, usually).

For that matter, the only language I can call myself proficient in is Elixir, while I have never coded professionally in the other three. So, while I tried my best to be as idiomatic as possible in each language, the code could still improve o lot, probably.

On a related note, feel free to drop a PR/open an issue if you have a better/more idiomatic solution. All learning is welcome!
